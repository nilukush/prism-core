# Frontend UI Fix Summary

## Issue
After login, the frontend was displaying an AI agent platform interface instead of the Product Management platform that PRISM is supposed to be.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Menu (`/frontend/src/components/app-shell.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Dashboard, Workspaces, Agents, Settings
- Bot icon for logo

**After:**
- Dashboard, Projects, Backlog, Sprints, PRDs, Teams, Settings
- FolderKanban icon for logo
- Added proper icons for each menu item

### 2. Dashboard Stats Cards (`/frontend/src/components/dashboard/stats-cards.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Total Agents: 24
- Active Executions: 8
- Avg. Response Time: 1.2s
- Success Rate: 98.5%

**After:**
- Active Projects: 12
- Current Sprint: Sprint 24 (5 days remaining)
- Sprint Velocity: 47 pts
- Story Completion: 92%

### 3. Recent Activity (`/frontend/src/components/dashboard/recent-activity.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Bot activities (Customer Support Bot responded to ticket, etc.)
- Agent names and avatars
- Status badges (completed, running, failed)

**After:**
- User activities (Sarah Chen created user story, Mike Johnson updated PRD, etc.)
- Real user names and avatars
- Project badges showing which project the activity relates to

### 4. Page Metadata (`/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`)
**Before:**
- OpenGraph title: "PRISM - AI Agent Platform"
- OpenGraph description: "Open source platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents at scale"
- Twitter card with same incorrect text

**After:**
- OpenGraph title: "PRISM - AI-Powered Product Management Platform"
- OpenGraph description: "Transform your product development with AI-powered user story generation, sprint planning, and intelligent analytics"
- Twitter card updated with correct text

## Result
The frontend now correctly displays:
- Product management terminology throughout
- Relevant metrics for project management (sprints, velocity, story completion)
- User activities instead of bot activities
- Proper navigation for product management features
- Correct metadata for SEO and social sharing

## Next Steps
The following pages still need to be created/updated:
- `/app/projects` - Project listing and management
- `/app/backlog` - Product backlog management
- `/app/sprints` - Sprint planning and tracking
- `/app/prds` - Product Requirements Documents
- `/app/teams` - Team management

These pages will need to be implemented to fully realize the Product Management platform vision.
