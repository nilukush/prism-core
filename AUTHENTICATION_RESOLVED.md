# Authentication Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue
User `nilukush@gmail.com` was unable to sign in despite email being registered in the system.

## Root Cause
The issue was simply an incorrect password. The user was attempting to login with `Test123!@#` but the actual password used during registration was `n1i6Lu!8`.

## Resolution
Once the correct password `n1i6Lu!8` was provided, authentication worked successfully:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=nilukush@gmail.com&password=n1i6Lu!8"
```

Response: 200 OK with JWT tokens

## Key Findings
1. The authentication system is working correctly
2. User account was properly activated (status=ACTIVE, email_verified=true)
3. Password verification using bcrypt is functioning as expected
4. JWT token generation and response format are correct

## Recommendations for Better User Experience
1. **Improved Error Messages**: Consider providing more specific error messages:
   - "Invalid email or password" for wrong credentials
   - "Please verify your email before logging in" for unverified accounts
   - "Your account has been locked due to multiple failed attempts" for locked accounts

2. **Password Reset Flow**: Implement the password reset functionality to help users who forget their passwords

3. **Login Attempt Tracking**: The system already tracks failed login attempts and locks accounts after 5 failures - this is good security practice

## Test Credentials
- Email: `nilukush@gmail.com`
- Password: `n1i6Lu!8`
- Status: Active and verified
