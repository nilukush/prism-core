Since "Protection Bypass for Automation" is not available, here are your alternatives:

## Option 1: Use Password Protection (Simplest)
Based on your screenshot, you have "Password Protection" available:

1. In Deployment Protection settings
2. Enable "Password Protection"
3. Enter a password (e.g., `prism2025`)
4. Save changes
5. When you visit the site, enter this password

**Pros**: Simple, works immediately
**Cons**: Need to enter password each time

## Option 2: Add Shareable Links
You might be able to create shareable links that bypass authentication:

1. Look for "Shareable Links" option
2. Generate a unique link
3. Share this link for access

## Option 3: Use Vercel Authentication (Current Setup)
Since you already have Vercel Authentication enabled:

1. Visit: https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app
2. Click "Continue with Vercel"
3. Sign in with your Vercel account
4. You'll have access

**Note**: This works if you're logged into your Vercel account

## Option 4: Change Protection Settings
Try different protection configurations:

1. Go to Deployment Protection
2. Try setting to "Standard Protection" only
3. Or try "Only Preview Deployments"
4. This might reveal different options

## Option 5: Deploy to Personal Account
If team restrictions are the issue:

1. Create a personal Vercel account
2. Deploy the frontend there
3. Personal accounts have more flexibility

## Option 6: Use Environment-Specific URLs
Vercel creates unique URLs for each deployment:
- Production: `frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app`
- Preview: `frontend-[hash]-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app`

Sometimes preview URLs have different protection settings.

## Option 7: API Access (Advanced)
Use Vercel API to update protection settings:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.vercel.com/v1/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/env \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "protectionBypass": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }'
```

## Immediate Recommendation

Since you need access now:
1. **Enable Password Protection** - This is visible in your settings
2. Set a simple password
3. Access your site with the password

This is the quickest solution while we figure out why Protection Bypass isn't showing.

## Why Protection Bypass Might Not Show

1. **Plan Limitation**: Might require Pro plan ($20/month)
2. **Team Settings**: Team admin might have restricted it
3. **Account Type**: Some account types don't have this feature
4. **Region**: Feature might not be available in all regions

## Next Steps

1. Try Password Protection first
2. Contact Vercel support about missing Protection Bypass
3. Consider upgrading to Pro if needed for this feature
