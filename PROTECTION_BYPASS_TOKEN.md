# üîê Generate Protection Bypass Token

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Deployment Protection Settings
Go to: https://vercel.com/nilukushs-projects/frontend/settings/deployment-protection

### 2. Find "Protection Bypass for Automation"
Scroll down to find this section. It should show:
- "Protection Bypass for Automation"
- "Generate a secret to bypass Deployment Protection"

### 3. Generate the Token
1. Click "Generate Secret" button
2. A token will appear (looks like: `abcd1234...`)
3. **COPY THIS TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** - You can't see it again!

### 4. Save the Token
Save it somewhere secure:
```
VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

## How to Use the Token

### Method 1: URL Parameter (Easy)
```
https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app?x-vercel-protection-bypass=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Method 2: Browser Bookmark
Create a bookmark with the full URL including token for easy access

### Method 3: With Cookie (Persistent)
First visit with the token URL, then add this header:
```
x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie: true
```
This saves the bypass in your browser

### Method 4: For Testing/Development
```bash
# Using curl
curl -H "x-vercel-protection-bypass: YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app

# Using HTTPie
http https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app \
     x-vercel-protection-bypass:YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Important Notes

1. **Keep Token Secret**: Anyone with this token can access your deployment
2. **Token Scope**: Works for ALL deployments in this project
3. **Regenerate if Compromised**: You can generate a new token anytime
4. **No Expiration**: Token doesn't expire unless regenerated

## Testing the Token

After generating:
1. Copy the token
2. Visit: `https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app?x-vercel-protection-bypass=YOUR_TOKEN`
3. You should see your app instead of the 401 page!

## Alternative: Disable Protection (Not Recommended)

If you want to make the site public:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection
2. Set "Vercel Authentication" to "Disabled"
3. Note: This might not work on team accounts

## Security Best Practices

- Don't commit the token to Git
- Don't share in public channels
- Use environment variables in CI/CD
- Regenerate periodically

Once you have the token, you can finally access your deployed frontend!
