# Authentication Issue Investigation Report

## Issue Summary
User with email `nilukush@gmail.com` was unable to sign in despite getting "email already registered" error during registration attempt.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. User Registration Status
- User was successfully registered in the database with ID: 4
- However, the account status was `PENDING` (not `ACTIVE`)
- Email verification flag was `false`
- Registration timestamp: 2025-07-08T11:13:27.191247Z

### 2. Authentication Logic
The authentication service (`backend/src/services/auth.py`) has the following requirements for successful login:
- User must exist in database
- Password must be correct
- Account must NOT be locked
- **Account status must be `ACTIVE`** (line 312-313)

### 3. Email Verification Issue
- The system is configured to use email verification for new registrations
- New users are created with status `PENDING` until email is verified
- The email service is using a **placeholder implementation** (`email_simple.py`) that doesn't actually send emails
- This means users never receive verification emails and remain in `PENDING` status

## Solution Applied

### Immediate Fix
Updated the user's database record directly:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET status = 'ACTIVE', 
    email_verified = true, 
    email_verified_at = NOW() 
WHERE email = 'nilukush@gmail.com';
```

### Verification
After the update:
- Status: `ACTIVE`
- Email Verified: `true`
- Email Verified At: `2025-07-08 15:00:18.73007+00`

## Recommendations

### 1. Short-term Solutions
- **Option A**: Configure a real email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.) to send verification emails
- **Option B**: For development, temporarily disable email verification requirement
- **Option C**: Create an admin tool to manually verify users

### 2. Long-term Solutions
- Implement proper email service configuration
- Add admin dashboard for user management
- Consider adding a "resend verification email" feature
- Add better error messages for login failures (distinguish between wrong password vs unverified account)

### 3. Development Environment
For local development, consider:
- Auto-verifying users in development mode
- Using a mail catcher service (like MailHog) to test emails locally
- Adding environment variable to bypass email verification

## Testing
Created test script at `/Users/nileshkumar/gh/prism/prism-core/test_login.py` to verify login functionality.

## Current Status
âœ… User `nilukush@gmail.com` can now successfully log in with their password.
