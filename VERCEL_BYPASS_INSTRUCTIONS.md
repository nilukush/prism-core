# üîì Vercel Deployment Protection Bypass Instructions

## Problem
Your frontend is deployed successfully but showing 401 Unauthorized due to Vercel team authentication that cannot be disabled at the team level.

## Solution: Protection Bypass Token

### Step 1: Generate Bypass Token
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/nilukushs-projects/frontend/settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Deployment Protection**
3. Find **"Protection Bypass for Automation"** section
4. Click **"Generate Secret"**
5. Copy the generated secret token

### Step 2: Access Your Deployment
Once you have the bypass token, you can access your deployment in two ways:

#### Option A: Direct URL Access
```
https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app?x-vercel-protection-bypass=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

#### Option B: Using Headers (for API/automated access)
```bash
curl -H "x-vercel-protection-bypass: YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN" \
     https://frontend-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Set Cookie for Browser Access
To avoid adding the token to every URL:
1. Visit the URL with token once
2. Add header `x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie: true`
3. Browser will save the bypass cookie for future visits

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Deploy to Personal Vercel Account
Create a personal Vercel account (not team) and deploy there - no authentication required.

### 2. Use Different Platform
Deploy to platforms without forced authentication:
- Netlify
- Render (static site hosting)
- Railway
- Surge.sh

### 3. Wait for Team Admin
Ask your team administrator to disable deployment protection at the team level (if possible).

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend code: All TypeScript/build errors fixed
- ‚úÖ Deployment: Successfully built and deployed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Access: Blocked by team authentication
- ‚úÖ Backend: Fully operational at https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com

Once you generate the bypass token, your PRISM application will be fully accessible!
