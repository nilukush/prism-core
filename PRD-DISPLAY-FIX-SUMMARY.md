# PRD Display Issue Investigation & Fix Summary

## Issue Description
PRDs generated by Claude Sonnet were not displaying in the UI, while mock AI service PRDs were displaying correctly. The user reported seeing nothing below the "Generate PRD" button after clicking it when using Claude.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Backend API Response Structure
The backend API (`/api/v1/ai/generate/prd`) returns the following structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "prd": "<prd_content>",
  "metadata": {
    "generated_at": "2024-01-20T10:30:00",
    "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "tokens_used": 2831
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Results
Running `test_ai_prd.sh` confirmed that:
- The backend is working correctly
- Anthropic service is returning PRD content
- The response structure is consistent between mock and Anthropic services

### 3. Frontend Code Analysis
The frontend code in `/frontend/src/app/app/prds/new/page.tsx`:
- Correctly sends the request to the API
- Expects `response.prd` to contain the PRD content
- Updates state with `setGeneratedPRD(response.prd)`
- Conditionally renders the PRD section when `generatedPRD` has content

## Potential Issues Identified

1. **Silent Failures**: The original code didn't log responses or errors in detail
2. **CSS/Styling Issues**: The `prose` and `whitespace-pre-wrap` classes might not be rendering content properly
3. **State Update Issues**: React state might not be updating properly
4. **Response Parsing**: The response might be getting lost in the API client handling

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Logging and Error Handling
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- API request initiation
- Raw response data
- PRD content length and preview
- Detailed error information

### 2. Improved Response Validation
- Added null/undefined checks for response and response.prd
- Added explicit error throwing for empty PRD content
- Better error messages for invalid response formats

### 3. Enhanced UI Display
- Added PRD length indicator for debugging
- Added provider and model information in the header
- Improved styling with background and border for better visibility
- Added a fallback debug view to show raw PRD text

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Wrapped PRD content in a styled container with background
- Added proper overflow handling
- Included a collapsible debug section to view raw JSON

## Code Changes

The main changes were made to `/frontend/src/app/app/prds/new/page.tsx`:

1. **Request/Response Logging**:
```typescript
console.log('Sending PRD generation request...')
console.log('Raw API Response:', response)
console.log('PRD Content Length:', response.prd?.length || 0)
console.log('PRD Content Preview:', response.prd?.substring(0, 100) || 'No content')
```

2. **Better Error Handling**:
```typescript
if (!response.prd) {
  throw new Error('PRD content is empty')
}
```

3. **Enhanced UI Display**:
```tsx
<div className="bg-muted/50 rounded-lg p-4 border border-border">
  <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap font-sans text-sm leading-relaxed overflow-x-auto">
    {generatedPRD}
  </pre>
</div>
```

## Next Steps for Debugging

If the issue persists after these changes:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors or the new console logs
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify the API response in browser DevTools
3. **Check React DevTools**: Verify that the `generatedPRD` state is being set
4. **Test with Different Content**: Try generating a PRD with very simple inputs to rule out content-specific issues

## How to Test

1. Rebuild and restart the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the browser console (F12)

3. Navigate to create a new PRD with AI enabled

4. Fill in the form and click "Generate PRD"

5. Watch the console for the new log messages

6. Check if the PRD displays, and if not, share the console logs

The enhanced logging and debug displays should help identify exactly where the issue is occurring in the flow from API response to UI rendering.
