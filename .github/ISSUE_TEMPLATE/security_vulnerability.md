To report a security vulnerability, please use one of the following methods:

### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
1. Go to the Security tab of this repository
2. Click on "Report a vulnerability"
3. Follow the private disclosure process

### Option 2: Email
Send details to: security@prism-ai.io

### What to Include in Your Report

- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect
- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
