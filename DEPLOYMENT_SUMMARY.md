# ðŸš€ PRISM Deployment Summary

## Live URLs

### Production (Public Access)
- **Frontend**: https://prism-frontend-kappa.vercel.app
- **Backend API**: https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com
- **Status**: âœ… LIVE and publicly accessible
- **Cost**: $0/month (free tiers)

### Alternative Frontend URL
- https://prism-9z5biinym-nilukushs-projects.vercel.app
- (Same deployment, different URL)

## Quick Deployment Commands

### Deploy Frontend Updates
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Monitor Backend Logs
```bash
# Via Render Dashboard
https://dashboard.render.com

# Or check health
curl https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/health
```

## Important Notes

1. **Backend Sleep**: Free Render tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request may take 30-60 seconds to wake up.

2. **CORS**: Backend is configured to accept requests from both Vercel URLs. If you deploy to a new URL, update `CORS_ORIGINS` in Render.

3. **For Sharing**: Use `https://prism-frontend-kappa.vercel.app` - it's shorter and cleaner.

4. **No GitHub Connection**: Currently using manual deployments to avoid build issues. This is working well.

## What PRISM Is

PRISM is the actual product - an AI-powered product management platform that helps teams:
- Generate user stories with AI
- Create PRDs automatically
- Manage sprints and projects
- Integrate with Jira, Confluence, Slack

It's not a landing page - it's the full application that users sign up for and use!
