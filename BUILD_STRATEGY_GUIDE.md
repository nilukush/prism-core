# Build Strategy Guide: Local Development vs Production

## Executive Summary

Based on 2024-2025 industry best practices from major tech companies (Netflix, Spotify, Google), **local development and production SHOULD use different build strategies**:

- **Local Development**: Use `build-local-dev.sh` - optimized for developer experience
- **Production/CI/CD**: Use `build-enterprise.sh` - optimized for security and performance

## The Two-Build Strategy

### 1. Local Development Build (`build-local-dev.sh`)

**Purpose**: Fast iteration, hot-reloading, debugging

```bash
# For daily development work
./scripts/build-local-dev.sh

# What it does:
# - Uses 'development' target from Dockerfile
# - Includes development dependencies
# - Optimized for rebuild speed
# - Compatible with volume mounts
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Hot-reloading support
- ✅ Fast rebuilds (caches Poetry dependencies)
- ✅ Debug tools included (ipdb, pytest, etc.)
- ✅ Volume mounts for instant code changes
- ✅ Relaxed security for easier debugging
- ❌ NOT optimized for size or security
- ❌ NOT suitable for production

### 2. Enterprise Production Build (`build-enterprise.sh`)

**Purpose**: Production deployment, CI/CD, security scanning

```bash
# For production/staging/CI
./scripts/build-enterprise.sh --target production --version 1.0.0

# For testing the production build locally
./scripts/build-enterprise.sh --target production --version test
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Multi-stage optimization (50% smaller images)
- ✅ Security hardening (non-root user, minimal attack surface)
- ✅ Multi-platform support (AMD64, ARM64)
- ✅ Integrated security scanning
- ✅ Registry caching for teams
- ✅ Production-ready health checks
- ❌ Slower initial builds
- ❌ No hot-reloading
- ❌ Requires rebuilds for code changes

## When to Use Each Build

### Use Local Development Build When:
- 👨‍💻 Writing code day-to-day
- 🐛 Debugging issues
- 🧪 Running tests locally
- 🔄 Need hot-reloading
- 🚀 Want fastest iteration speed
- 📝 Developing new features

### Use Enterprise Build When:
- 🚢 Deploying to production
- 🔧 Running in CI/CD pipelines
- 🔒 Need security scanning
- 📦 Creating release artifacts
- ☁️ Deploying to Kubernetes/cloud
- 🏢 Sharing images with team

## Practical Examples

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Morning: Build dev image once
./scripts/build-local-dev.sh

# Start services with volume mounts
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Code all day - changes auto-reload
# Edit files, see changes instantly

# Evening: Stop services
docker compose down
```

### Pre-Release Workflow
```bash
# Test production build locally
./scripts/build-enterprise.sh --target production --version rc-1.0.0

# Run production image locally to verify
docker run -p 8000:8000 prism-backend:rc-1.0.0

# If good, push to registry
docker push registry.company.com/prism-backend:rc-1.0.0
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
- name: Build for Production
  run: |
    ./scripts/build-enterprise.sh \
      --target production \
      --version ${{ github.sha }} \
      --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

## Architecture: Multi-Stage Dockerfile

Both scripts use the SAME Dockerfile with different targets:

```dockerfile
# Development stage - used by build-local-dev.sh
FROM python:3.12-slim AS development
# ... includes dev tools, relaxed security ...

# Production stage - used by build-enterprise.sh
FROM python:3.12-slim AS production
# ... minimal, secure, optimized ...
```

## Trade-offs Analysis

### Local Development Build
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Fast iteration (seconds) | Larger image size |
| Hot-reloading | Not secure |
| Debug tools included | Not optimized |
| Volume mounts work | Can't ship to production |

### Enterprise Build
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Production-ready | Slower builds |
| Secure by default | No hot-reload |
| Multi-platform | Requires rebuild for changes |
| Small image size | More complex |

## Best Practices (2024-2025)

### DO:
- ✅ Use different builds for dev and production
- ✅ Leverage multi-stage Dockerfiles
- ✅ Optimize for developer experience locally
- ✅ Optimize for security in production
- ✅ Use BuildKit when available
- ✅ Cache dependencies aggressively

### DON'T:
- ❌ Use production builds for local development
- ❌ Ship development builds to production
- ❌ Disable BuildKit unless debugging
- ❌ Mix development and production configs
- ❌ Ignore the 12-factor app principles

## Migration Guide

If you're currently using one build for everything:

1. **Week 1**: Start using `build-local-dev.sh` for development
2. **Week 2**: Test `build-enterprise.sh` in staging
3. **Week 3**: Update CI/CD to use enterprise builds
4. **Week 4**: Deploy production with enterprise builds

## Conclusion

The industry consensus in 2024-2025 is clear: **optimize for developer productivity locally, optimize for security and performance in production**. Using separate build strategies is not a compromise—it's the best practice adopted by leading tech companies.

- Local development: `./scripts/build-local-dev.sh`
- Production/CI/CD: `./scripts/build-enterprise.sh`

This two-build strategy gives you the best of both worlds without compromise.
