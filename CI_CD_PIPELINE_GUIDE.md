# Enterprise CI/CD Pipeline Guide

## Overview

PRISM implements a comprehensive DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and reliability at every stage of the software development lifecycle. This guide details our enterprise-grade pipeline architecture and best practices.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Shift-Left Security**: Security scanning starts from the first commit
2. **Automated Everything**: From testing to deployment, everything is automated
3. **Fail Fast**: Issues are caught early in the development cycle
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Containers are built once and promoted through environments
5. **Zero Trust**: Every component is verified and signed

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Code Commit Stage
**Trigger**: Push to any branch

#### Security Scanning
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog and GitLeaks scan for exposed credentials
- **Dependency Scanning**: Trivy checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Automated license compatibility checks

#### Code Quality
- **Linting**: 
  - Python: Ruff, Black, MyPy
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier
- **Formatting**: Automatic code formatting validation
- **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity checks

### 2. Build & Test Stage
**Trigger**: After security scanning passes

#### Backend Testing
```yaml
Services Required:
- PostgreSQL 16
- Redis 7
- Qdrant (for vector DB)

Test Types:
- Unit Tests (pytest)
- Integration Tests
- API Contract Tests
- Performance Tests
```

#### Frontend Testing
```yaml
Test Types:
- Unit Tests (Jest)
- Component Tests (React Testing Library)
- E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Visual Regression Tests
- Accessibility Tests (axe-core)
```

#### Security Testing
- **SAST**: Semgrep with OWASP rules
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy and Grype
- **IaC Scanning**: Checkov and tfsec
- **API Security**: 42Crunch API audit

### 3. Container Build Stage
**Trigger**: After all tests pass

#### Build Process
1. Multi-stage Dockerfile for minimal image size
2. Distroless base images where possible
3. Non-root user execution
4. Health check endpoints included

#### Security Measures
- Image signing with Cosign
- SBOM generation for supply chain security
- Vulnerability scanning before push
- Attestation creation for provenance

### 4. Deployment Stage

#### Staging Deployment
**Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
- Automatic deployment to staging environment
- Smoke tests execution
- Performance baseline tests
- Security scanning of running application

#### Production Deployment
**Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or version tag
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for critical changes
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Post-deployment validation

## Security Integration

### DevSecOps Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Stage |
|------|---------|--------|
| TruffleHog | Secret scanning | Pre-commit |
| GitLeaks | Credential detection | Pre-commit |
| Semgrep | SAST analysis | Build |
| Trivy | Vulnerability scanning | Build |
| Cosign | Container signing | Release |
| OWASP ZAP | DAST scanning | Staging |
| SonarCloud | Code quality | Build |
| Snyk | Dependency analysis | Build |

### Security Gates

Each stage has security gates that must pass:

1. **No Secrets**: Zero hardcoded credentials
2. **No Critical Vulnerabilities**: In dependencies or containers
3. **License Compliance**: Only approved licenses
4. **Security Headers**: All required headers present
5. **OWASP Compliance**: No OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

## Compliance & Audit

### Automated Compliance Checks
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
- PCI DSS requirements (if applicable)
- GDPR data handling
- SOC 2 controls
- HIPAA (if healthcare data)

### Audit Trail
Every pipeline execution maintains:
- Complete build logs
- Security scan results
- Test results and coverage
- Deployment records
- Approval workflows

## Performance Optimization

### Pipeline Performance
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel
- **Caching**: Dependencies and Docker layers cached
- **Incremental Builds**: Only changed components rebuilt
- **Resource Allocation**: Appropriate runner sizes

### Metrics Tracked
- Build time
- Test execution time
- Deployment frequency
- Failure rate
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## Environments

### Environment Progression
```
Local → CI → Staging → Production
```

Each environment has:
- Isolated infrastructure
- Environment-specific configurations
- Appropriate security controls
- Monitoring and alerting

## Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
1. Health check failures
2. Error rate exceeds threshold
3. Performance degradation
4. Security vulnerability detected

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run rollback.yml -f version=v1.2.3

# Via kubectl (emergency)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/prism-backend
kubectl rollout undo deployment/prism-frontend
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Pipeline Monitoring
- Build success/failure rates
- Average build time
- Queue time
- Resource utilization

### Application Monitoring
- APM with distributed tracing
- Custom business metrics
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Small, Frequent Commits**: Easier to review and test
2. **Feature Flags**: Deploy code without releasing features
3. **Branch Protection**: Require PR reviews and passing tests
4. **Local Testing**: Run tests locally before pushing

### For DevOps
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure in version control
2. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Never modify running containers
3. **Secret Management**: Use secret management services
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Regular backup and restore tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check logs
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Re-run with debug
gh workflow run ci-cd-pipeline.yml -f debug_enabled=true
```

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Run specific test locally
docker compose run backend pytest tests/test_specific.py -v

# Check test artifacts
gh run download <run-id> -n test-results
```

#### Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl rollout status deployment/prism-backend

# View pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=prism-backend --tail=100
```

## Cost Optimization

### Strategies
1. **Use spot instances** for non-critical builds
2. **Cache aggressively** to reduce build time
3. **Clean up old artifacts** automatically
4. **Right-size runners** based on workload
5. **Schedule non-critical jobs** during off-peak

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **GitOps with ArgoCD**: Declarative deployments
2. **Chaos Engineering**: Automated resilience testing
3. **AI-Powered Testing**: Smart test selection
4. **Progressive Delivery**: Feature flag integration
5. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Deploy anywhere
