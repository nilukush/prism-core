# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-19

### Files Removed

The following categories of files were removed from the repository to make it suitable for public release:

#### Environment and Configuration Files
- `.env` - Environment variables file
- `.env.example` - Example environment file
- `redis.conf` - Redis configuration
- `redis.conf.template` - Redis configuration template
- `redis.dev.conf` - Redis development configuration
- `supervisor.conf` - Supervisor configuration

#### Internal Documentation Files
All markdown files that contained internal documentation, deployment guides, fixes, and implementation details were removed, including but not limited to:
- `analyze.md`
- `kubernetes-deploy-fix.md`
- `db_deployment.md`
- `vpc_deployment.md`
- Various configuration and setup documentation files

#### Python Scripts
- `custom_blocks_demo_v1_rev1.py` - Internal demo script

#### Sensitive Scripts (from scripts/ directory)
- `generate-secrets.sh` - Secret generation script
- `setup-credentials.sh` - Credential setup script
- `prepare-deployment.sh` - Deployment preparation script
- `build-enterprise.sh` - Enterprise build script

### Remaining Structure

The repository now contains only:
- Core application code (backend/, frontend/)
- Public documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
- Docker and deployment configurations (docker-compose files)
- Infrastructure as code (k8s/, helm/)
- Development scripts suitable for public use
- Standard project files (.gitignore, LICENSE, etc.)

### Recommendations

1. Review all remaining configuration files to ensure no sensitive data remains
2. Update README.md with appropriate public-facing documentation
3. Ensure all API keys and secrets are properly documented as environment variables
4. Add a .env.example file with dummy values for required environment variables
5. Review and update docker-compose files to remove any internal references
