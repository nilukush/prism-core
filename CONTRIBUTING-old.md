   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   
   # Install dependencies
   poetry install

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: We use Black for formatting and Ruff for linting
  ```bash
  poetry run black backend/
  poetry run ruff check backend/
  ```

- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all functions
  ```python
  def process_data(input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ProcessedResult:
      ...
  ```

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
  ```python
  def function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
      """
      Brief description.
      
      Args:
          param1: Description of param1
          param2: Description of param2
          
      Returns:
          Description of return value
          
      Raises:
          ValueError: When validation fails
      """
  ```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use pytest for testing
- Mock external dependencies

Example test:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_story(client: AsyncClient):
    """Test story creation."""
    response = await client.post(
        "/api/v1/stories",
        json={"title": "Test Story", "description": "Test"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
```

### Database Migrations

- Use Alembic for migrations
- Test migrations on a copy of production data
- Include both upgrade and downgrade paths

```bash
# Create migration
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add new table"

# Run migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Version APIs appropriately
- Document all endpoints

### Security

- Never commit sensitive data
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate all inputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines
