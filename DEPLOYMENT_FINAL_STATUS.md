# 📊 Deployment Final Status

## ✅ Render Backend - FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **URL**: https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com
- **Status**: Live and healthy
- **API Docs**: https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/docs

## ❌ Vercel Frontend - NPM Issue

### Current Error
```
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@radix-ui%2freact-skeleton
```

### Quick Fix in Vercel Dashboard

Go to **Settings → Build & Development Settings** and change:

**Install Command** to one of these:
1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force` (Try this first)
2. `yarn install` (If npm fails)
3. `npx pnpm install` (Alternative)

### Why This Happens
- npm is URL-encoding the `/` in package names to `%2f`
- This is a known npm issue with scoped packages
- Using legacy mode or alternative package managers fixes it

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix Vercel Install Command** (2 min)
   - Use one of the commands above
   - Save and redeploy

2. **Once Frontend Deploys**
