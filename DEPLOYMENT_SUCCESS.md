# üéâ DEPLOYMENT UPDATE

## ‚úÖ Render Backend - NOW LIVE!

Your backend is successfully deployed and running:
- **URL**: https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Healthy
- **API Docs**: https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/docs

### What Fixed It:
1. The AnthropicClient error was resolved
2. Redis connection error was handled gracefully
3. Service started successfully

## ‚ùå Vercel Frontend - Still Needs Fix

### The Issue:
- Vercel is still deploying old commit (`2db96be`)
- Latest commit with fixes is `5405bfb`

### IMMEDIATE FIX - Do One of These:

### Option 1: Use Vercel CLI (Fastest)
```bash
cd frontend
npm i -g vercel  # Install CLI if needed
vercel login     # Login if needed
vercel --prod --force
```

### Option 2: Force Latest Commit in Dashboard
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Create Deployment"
3. Enter commit: `5405bfb`
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Delete and Recreate Project
1. Delete project in Vercel
2. Create new project
3. Import from GitHub
4. Set Root Directory to `frontend`
5. Ensure build commands are:
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Install: `npm install`

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

### Test Backend (Working Now!)
```bash
# Health check
curl https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/health

# View API documentation
open https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/docs

# Test API root
curl https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/
```

### After Vercel is Fixed
Update these environment variables in Vercel:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32]
```

## Summary
