cd backend && pytest

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Run specific test file
pytest backend/tests/test_auth.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src backend/tests/
```

make lint

# Format Python code
cd backend && black src/ tests/

# Format TypeScript/JavaScript code
cd frontend && npm run format

# Type checking
cd backend && mypy src/
cd frontend && npm run type-check
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the following additions:

- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maximum line length is 88 characters (Black default)
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Docstrings should follow Google style

```python
# Good example
from typing import List, Optional

async def create_agent(
    name: str,
    config: dict,
    tools: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> Agent:
    """Create a new AI agent.
    
    Args:
        name: The name of the agent
        config: Agent configuration dictionary
        tools: Optional list of tool names to enable
        
    Returns:
        The created Agent instance
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the configuration is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use functional components with hooks for React
- Prefer named exports over default exports

```typescript
// Good example
export interface AgentConfig {
  name: string
  model: string
  temperature?: number
}

export const createAgent = async (
  config: AgentConfig
): Promise<Agent> => {
  // Implementation
}
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create custom components using CVA (class-variance-authority)
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(agents): add memory persistence for chat agents"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(api): update workspace endpoints documentation"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change agent configuration schema

BREAKING CHANGE: The 'config' field now requires a 'model' property"
```

## Development Tips

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run with debugger
python -m debugpy --listen 5678 --wait-for-client -m uvicorn src.main:app

# Frontend debugging
cd frontend && npm run dev -- --inspect
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run performance tests
cd backend && locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py

# Profile Python code
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats src/main.py
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
cd backend && alembic revision -m "add_new_field_to_agents"

# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback migration
alembic downgrade -1
```
