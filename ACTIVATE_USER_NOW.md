# ðŸš¨ Immediate Login Fix

## The Issue
- You set `DEBUG=true` in Render
- Backend code checks `settings.DEBUG` 
- Both `DEBUG` and `APP_DEBUG` should work according to config.py
- But debug endpoints show 404, meaning DEBUG mode isn't active

## Solution 1: Check Current Environment
```bash
# SSH into Render to verify
render ssh srv-d1r6j47fte5s73cnonqg

# Once connected, check:
env | grep -i debug
echo $DEBUG
echo $APP_DEBUG
python -c "from backend.src.core.config import settings; print(f'DEBUG={settings.DEBUG}')"
```

## Solution 2: Force Activation via API

Since you can't login, let's try a different approach. The backend has a password reset flow that might help:

```bash
# Try password reset endpoint
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "nilukush@gmail.com"}'
```

## Solution 3: Register New Account and Test

Register a new account to test if the issue is specific to your first account:

```bash
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "nilukush+test1@gmail.com",
    "password": "Test123!",
    "full_name": "Test User"
  }'
```

Then immediately try to login:
```bash
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=nilukush+test1@gmail.com&password=Test123!&grant_type=password"
```

## Solution 4: Update Render Environment (Most Likely Fix)

The issue might be that environment variables are case-sensitive. Try:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Remove the current `DEBUG=true`
3. Add BOTH:
   - `APP_DEBUG=true`
   - `DEBUG=true`
4. Also add:
   - `APP_ENV=development`
5. Save and redeploy

## Solution 5: Direct Database Access

If you have database credentials in Render:
1. Click on your PostgreSQL database in Render
2. Get the connection string
3. Use any PostgreSQL client to connect
4. Run:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET status = 'active', 
    email_verified = true, 
    email_verified_at = NOW() 
WHERE email = 'nilukush@gmail.com';
```

## The Root Cause

The backend is running but `settings.DEBUG` is False, which means:
1. Debug endpoints aren't available
2. Pending users can't login
3. Email verification is required

The deployment logs show "environment": "development" but that's from APP_ENV, not DEBUG.
