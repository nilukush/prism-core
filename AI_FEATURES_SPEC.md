# PRISM AI Features Specification

## Overview
PRISM is an AI-Powered Product Management Platform that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance and automate key product management tasks. The AI features are designed to streamline workflows, improve quality, and reduce manual effort while maintaining human oversight.

## Core AI Features

### 1. AI-Powered User Story Generation

#### Features:
- **Natural Language Input**: Accept brief descriptions or requirements in plain English
- **Structured Output**: Generate properly formatted user stories following the standard template:
  - "As a [persona], I want to [feature], so that [benefit]"
- **Context Awareness**: Understand project context and maintain consistency across stories
- **Bulk Generation**: Create multiple related stories from a single feature description

#### Example:
```
Input: "Users need to reset their password if they forget it"

Output:
- As a registered user, I want to reset my password via email, so that I can regain access to my account
- As a system administrator, I want to monitor password reset attempts, so that I can detect potential security issues
- As a user, I want to receive a confirmation email after resetting my password, so that I know the change was successful
```

#### Backend Integration:
- Uses the existing `agents` table with type = 'STORY_GENERATOR'
- Leverages OpenAI/Claude API for story generation
- Stores context in `agent_memory` for consistency

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Generation

#### Features:
- **Automatic Generation**: Create detailed acceptance criteria from user stories
- **Gherkin Format Support**: Generate Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Edge Case Detection**: Identify and suggest edge cases to test
- **Quality Checks**: Ensure criteria are testable and measurable

#### Example:
```
User Story: "As a user, I want to filter products by price range"

Generated Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am on the products page
  When I set the minimum price to $10 and maximum price to $50
  Then I should only see products priced between $10 and $50
  
- Given no products exist in the selected price range
  When I apply the price filter
  Then I should see a "No products found" message
  
- Given I have applied a price filter
  When I click "Clear filters"
  Then all products should be displayed again
```

### 3. Sprint Planning AI Assistant

#### Features:
- **Story Point Estimation**: AI-powered estimation based on historical data
- **Sprint Capacity Planning**: Recommend optimal story allocation based on team velocity
- **Dependency Detection**: Identify story dependencies and suggest ordering
- **Risk Assessment**: Highlight potential blockers or risks

#### Dashboard Integration:
- **Sprint Health Score**: AI-calculated metric showing sprint progress risk
- **Velocity Prediction**: Forecast sprint completion based on current progress
- **Burndown Insights**: Identify trends and suggest corrective actions

### 4. PRD Generation Assistant

#### Features:
- **Template-Based Generation**: Create comprehensive PRDs from feature descriptions
- **Section Suggestions**: AI recommends relevant sections based on feature type
- **Market Research Integration**: Pull in relevant market data and competitor analysis
- **Technical Specification**: Generate initial technical requirements

#### Sections Generated:
1. Executive Summary
2. Problem Statement
3. User Personas
4. Functional Requirements
5. Non-functional Requirements
6. Success Metrics
7. Technical Considerations
8. Timeline Estimation

### 5. Intelligent Analytics & Insights

#### Features:
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast project completion dates
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify workflow inefficiencies
- **Team Performance Insights**: Analyze productivity patterns
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest process improvements

#### Dashboard Widgets:
- **AI Insights Panel**: Daily AI-generated insights about project health
- **Risk Alerts**: Proactive notifications about potential issues
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Workflow improvement recommendations

## Implementation Architecture

### Backend Components:

1. **AI Service Layer** (`/backend/src/services/ai/`)
   - `story_generator.py`: User story generation logic
   - `criteria_generator.py`: Acceptance criteria generation
   - `sprint_planner.py`: Sprint planning assistance
   - `prd_generator.py`: PRD creation service
   - `analytics_engine.py`: Predictive analytics

2. **API Endpoints** (`/backend/src/api/v1/ai/`)
   - `POST /api/v1/ai/generate-stories`: Generate user stories
   - `POST /api/v1/ai/generate-criteria`: Generate acceptance criteria
   - `POST /api/v1/ai/estimate-story`: Get story point estimation
   - `POST /api/v1/ai/analyze-sprint`: Get sprint insights
   - `POST /api/v1/ai/generate-prd`: Create PRD draft

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Utilize existing `agents` table for AI agent configurations
   - `agent_executions` for tracking AI operations
   - `agent_memory` for maintaining context
   - New table: `ai_insights` for storing generated insights

### Frontend Components:

1. **AI Action Buttons**:
   - "Generate with AI" button on story creation forms
   - "AI Suggest" for acceptance criteria
   - "AI Estimate" for story points

2. **AI Insights Dashboard**:
   - Dedicated widget showing AI-generated insights
   - Real-time notifications for AI suggestions
   - Historical AI recommendation tracking

3. **AI Configuration Settings**:
   - Model selection (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

## User Experience Flow

### Story Creation with AI:
1. User clicks "Create Story" â†’ "Generate with AI"
2. Modal appears with text input for requirements
3. User enters: "Users should be able to export their data"
4. AI generates 3-5 story options
5. User selects/edits stories before saving
6. AI automatically suggests acceptance criteria
7. User reviews and approves

### Sprint Planning with AI:
1. User navigates to Sprint Planning
2. AI Assistant panel shows:
   - Recommended stories for sprint based on velocity
