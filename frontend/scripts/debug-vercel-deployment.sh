echo ""
echo "üîç PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:"
echo "--------------------------------"

echo ""

echo "‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED:"

echo "-------------------------"
echo "1. Go to your Vercel dashboard"
echo "2. Click on your project"
echo "3. Go to the 'Deployments' tab"
echo "4. Click 'Redeploy' on the latest deployment"
echo "5. Or trigger a new deployment by:"
echo "   - Making a new commit"
echo "   - Using the 'Deploy' button in Vercel"
echo "   - Running: vercel --prod (if logged in)"
echo ""

echo "üîß VERCEL CLI COMMANDS (requires login):"
echo "----------------------------------------"
echo "vercel login                  # Login to Vercel"
echo "vercel                        # Deploy to preview"
echo "vercel --prod                 # Deploy to production"
echo "vercel logs                   # View deployment logs"
echo "vercel ls                     # List recent deployments"
