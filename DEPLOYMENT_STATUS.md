2. **Verify all environment variables** are set in Render
3. **Ensure database is active** (check Neon dashboard)
4. **Try manual restart** in Render dashboard

### 📊 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
./scripts/check-render-status.sh

# Monitor with full details (once live)
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh

# Test local setup
curl http://localhost:8100/health

# View local API docs
open http://localhost:8100/docs
```

### 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **API Key Security**: Regenerate your OpenAI key if it was exposed
2. **First Deployment**: Always takes longer (building image)
3. **Cold Starts**: Free tier may sleep after 15 min inactivity
4. **Monitoring**: Check costs daily for first week

### 📞 Next Steps

1. Wait for Render deployment (check every 2-3 minutes)
2. Once live, update environment variables
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel
4. Test full end-to-end flow
5. Monitor costs for 24 hours
