# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Critical & High  |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                | None             |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The PRISM team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: security@prism.example.com
2. **Security Advisory**: [Create a security advisory](https://github.com/prism/prism-core/security/advisories/new) on GitHub
3. **Bug Bounty Program**: https://bugbounty.prism.example.com (if applicable)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

## Security Measures

### Code Security

1. **Static Analysis**: All code is scanned using:
   - Semgrep for SAST
   - CodeQL for vulnerability detection
   - Bandit for Python security issues
   - ESLint security plugins for JavaScript

2. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - Daily Dependabot scans
   - Trivy for container dependencies
   - OWASP Dependency Check
   - License compliance checks

3. **Container Security**:
   - Base images scanned for vulnerabilities
   - Images signed with Cosign
   - SBOM generated for all releases
   - Minimal, distroless images where possible

### Runtime Security

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Session management with automatic timeout

2. **Data Protection**:
   - All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - Sensitive data encrypted at rest
   - Secrets managed via environment variables
   - No hardcoded credentials

3. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CORS properly configured
   - Security headers implemented

4. **Infrastructure Security**:
   - Network segmentation
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular security patching
   - Intrusion detection systems

### Compliance

PRISM is designed to meet the following compliance standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Infrastructure hardening
- **PCI DSS**: If processing payment data
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls
- **GDPR**: Data privacy compliance

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Features

1. **Password Policy**:
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Complexity requirements
   - Password history
   - Account lockout after failed attempts

2. **Audit Logging**:
   - All security events logged
   - Tamper-proof audit trail
   - Log forwarding to SIEM
   - Retention per compliance requirements

3. **Encryption**:
   - AES-256 for data at rest
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Encrypted backups
   - Key rotation policies

## Development Security Practices

### Secure Development Lifecycle

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Threat modeling for new features
   - Security architecture review
   - Privacy impact assessment

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Secure coding guidelines
   - Peer code reviews
   - Security-focused unit tests

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - SAST/DAST scanning
   - Penetration testing
   - Security regression tests

4. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Automated security checks in CI/CD
   - Container scanning
   - Configuration validation

### Security Training

All developers must complete:
- Annual security awareness training
- OWASP secure coding practices
- Framework-specific security training

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Response**: Incident response team activation
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and patch vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review
