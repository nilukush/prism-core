## Converting TODOs to Issues

When converting these TODOs to GitHub issues:

1. Create labels: `todo`, `backend`, `frontend`, `security`, `performance`
2. Add appropriate priority labels: `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`
3. Include context from the code where the TODO was found
4. Link related TODOs as a single epic when appropriate
5. Add to appropriate project board/milestone

## Notes

- Total TODO comments found: ~20 in core source files
- Many are placeholder implementations that need to be completed
- Some may be removed if the feature is not part of the MVP
- Priority should be given to security and data access TODOs
