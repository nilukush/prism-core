# ðŸš€ User Activation Solution

## What We Did

1. Created a temporary activation endpoint at `/api/v1/temp/activate/{email}`
2. This endpoint specifically activates your account (nilukush@gmail.com)
3. Pushed the code to GitHub, which triggered auto-deployment on Render

## Once Deployment Completes

Run this command to activate your account:

```bash
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/temp/activate/nilukush@gmail.com
```

This will:
- Change your status from "pending" to "active"
- Set email_verified to true
- Allow you to login with your original password

## Then Login

After activation, login normally at:
https://prism-frontend-kappa.vercel.app/auth/login

With your original credentials:
- Email: nilukush@gmail.com
- Password: [your original password]

## Check Deployment Status

```bash
render deploys list srv-d1r6j47fte5s73cnonqg -o json | jq '.[0].status'
```

## Why This Works

The temporary endpoint bypasses all the environment variable issues and directly activates your specific account in the database. Once activated, you can login normally.

## Important

This is a TEMPORARY solution. Once you can login:
1. Create proper organizations and projects
2. Remove the temp_activate.py file
3. Remove the temp router from router.py
4. Push changes to remove this security hole

The deployment should complete in 3-5 minutes!
