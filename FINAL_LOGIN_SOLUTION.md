# 🔐 Final Login Solution

## The Problem
Your account exists but is in "pending" status, and APP_DEBUG=true isn't enabling debug mode properly because the backend considers itself in "production" mode.

## Solution 1: Create New Account and Test

Let's create a fresh account to verify the system works:

```bash
# Register new account
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"nilukush2@gmail.com","password":"Test123!","full_name":"Nilesh Kumar"}'

# Try to login immediately
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=nilukush2@gmail.com&password=Test123!&grant_type=password"
```

## Solution 2: Add More Environment Variables

The backend might need multiple environment variables. Add ALL of these to Render:

```
APP_ENV=development
APP_DEBUG=true
DEBUG=true
ENVIRONMENT=development
SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true
```

## Solution 3: Direct Database Access

Since you're on Render, you should have a PostgreSQL database. In Render Dashboard:

1. Click on your PostgreSQL database
2. Copy the "External Database URL"
3. Use any PostgreSQL client (TablePlus, pgAdmin, or command line)
4. Connect and run:

```sql
-- Check your user
SELECT id, email, username, status, email_verified, is_active 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'nilukush@gmail.com';

-- Activate your user
UPDATE users 
SET status = 'active', 
    email_verified = true, 
    email_verified_at = NOW(),
    is_active = true
WHERE email = 'nilukush@gmail.com';
```

## Solution 4: Password Reset Flow

Try the password reset endpoint which might bypass the status check:

```bash
curl -X POST https://prism-backend-bwfx.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "nilukush@gmail.com"}'
```

## Solution 5: Check Render Logs for Clues

```bash
# Get recent logs
render logs -r srv-d1r6j47fte5s73cnonqg --limit 100 -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.message | contains("nilukush")) | .message' 2>/dev/null
```

## Why This Is Happening

The backend code shows:
1. API docs are disabled when `settings.is_production` is True
2. Debug routes only load when `settings.DEBUG` is True
3. Your backend thinks it's in production mode despite APP_DEBUG=true

## Immediate Action

Try Solution 1 first - create a new account with a simple password and see if it works. This will tell us if the issue is specific to your first account or a system-wide problem.
